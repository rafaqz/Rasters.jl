# Array operations

Most base methods work as for regular julia `Array`s, such as `reverse` and
rotations like `rotl90`. Base, statistics and linear algebra methods like `mean`
that take a `dims` argument can also use the dimension name. 

## Mean over the time dimension:

````@example operations
using Rasters, Statistics, RasterDataSources

A = Raster(WorldClim{BioClim}, 5)
````

Then we do the mean over the `X` dimension

````@example operations
mean(A, dims=X) # Ti if time were available would also be possible
````

`broadcast` works lazily from disk when `lazy=true`, and is only applied when data
is directly indexed. Adding a dot to any function will use broadcast over a `Raster`
just like an `Array`. 

## Broadcasting

For a disk-based array `A`, this will only be applied when indexing occurs or
when we [`read`](@ref) the array.

````@example operations
A .*= 2
````

To broadcast directly to disk, we need to open the file in write mode:

````julia
open(Raster(filename); write=true) do O
   O .*= 2
end
````

To broadcast over a `RasterStack` use `map`, which applies a function to
the raster layers of the stack.

````julia
newstack = map(stack) do raster
   raster .* 2
end
````

## Modifying object properties

`rebuild` can be used to modify the fields of an object, generating a new object
(but possibly holding the same arrays or files).

If you know that a file had an incorrectly specified missing value, you can do:

### rebuild

````@example operations
A = Raster(WorldClim{BioClim}, 5)
rebuild(A; missingval=-9999)
````

(`replace_missing` will actually replace the current values).

Or if you need to change the name of the layer:

Then use `rebuild` as

````@example operations
B = rebuild(A; name=:temperature)
B.name
````

### replace_missing

````@example operations
replace_missing(A, missingval=-9999)
````

### set

`set` can be used to modify the nested properties of an objects dimensions, that
are more difficult to change with `rebuild`. `set` works on the principle that
dimension properties can only be in one specific field, so we generally don't
have to specify which one it is. `set` will also try to update anything affected
by a change you make.

This will set the `X` axis to specify points, instead of intervals:

````@example operations
using Rasters: Points
set(A, X => Points)
````

We can also reassign dimensions, here `X` becomes `Z`:

````@example operations
set(A, X => Z)
````

`setcrs(A, crs)` and `setmappedcrs(A, crs)` will set the crs value/s of an
object to any `GeoFormat` from GeoFormatTypes.jl.
