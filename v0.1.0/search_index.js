Indexing a RasterStack by name is always lazy, while view of a Raster is lazy and getindex will load to memory. read can be used on any object to ensure that all data is loaded to memory.\nBroadcast over disk-based objects is lazy - it will only run when the array is indexed. Always prefer broadcasts to explicit loops - these can be very slow with disk-based data.\n\nData-source abstraction\n\nRasters provides a standardised interface that allows many source data types to be used with identical syntax.\n\nScripts and packages building on Rasters.jl can treat AbstractRaster, AbstractRasterStack, and AbstrackRasterSeries as black boxes.\nThe data could hold GeoTiff or NetCDF files, Arrays in memory or CuArrays on the GPU - they will all behave in the same way.\nAbstractRasterStack can be a Netcdf or HDF5 file, or a NamedTuple of GDALarray holding .tif files, or all Raster in memory.\nUsers do not have to deal with the specifics of spatial file types.\nFor Projected mode you can index with any projection by setting the mappedcrs keyword on construction. You don't need to know the underlying projection, the conversion is handled automatically. This means lat/lon EPSG(4326) can be used across all sources seamlessly if you need that.\nRegions and points selected with Between and Contains select the right point or whole interval no matter the order of the index or it's position in the cell.\n\nNamed dimensions and index lookups\n\nRasters.jl extends DimensionalData.jl so that spatial data can be indexed using named dimensions like X, Y and Ti (time) and e.g. spatial coordinates.\n\nDimensions can also be used in most Base and Statistics methods like mean and reduce where dims arguments are required. Much of the behaviour is covered in the DimensionalData docs.\n\nSee the docs for more details and examples for Rasters.jl.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"module"},{"location":"#Common-Applications","page":"Rasters.jl","title":"Common Applications","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"#Subsetting-an-object","page":"Rasters.jl","title":"Subsetting an object","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Rasters.jl","title":"Rasters.jl","text":"Regular getindex (e.g. A[1:100, :]) and view work on all objects just as with an Array. view is always lazy, and reads from disk are deferred until getindex is used.

The write keyword opens the file in write lookup so that it can be altered on disk using e.g. a broadcast.\n\nf is a method that accepts a single argument - an Raster object which is just an AbstractRaster that holds an open disk-based object. Often it will be a do block:\n\n# A is an `Raster` wrapping the opened disk-based object.\nopen(Raster(filepath); write=true) do A\n    mask!(A; to=maskfile)\n    A[I...] .*= 2\n    # ...  other things you need to do with the open file\nend\n\nBy using a do block to open files we ensure they are always closed again after we finish working with them.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"#Base.read","page":"Rasters.jl","title":"Base.read","text":"read(A::AbstractRaster)\nread(A::AbstractRasterStack)\nread(A::AbstractRasterSeries)\n\nread will move a Rasters.jl object completely to memory.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"#Base.read!","page":"Rasters.jl","title":"Base.read!","text":"read!(src::Union{AbstractString,AbstractRaster}, dst::AbstractRaster)\nread!(src::Union{AbstractString,AbstractRasterStack}, dst::AbstractRasterStack)\nread!(scr::AbstractRasterSeries, dst::AbstractRasterSeries)\n\nread! will copy the data from src to the object dst. \n\nsrc can be an object or a file-path String.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"#Base.write","page":"Rasters.jl","title":"Base.write","text":"Base.write(filename::AbstractString, ::Type{GRDfile}, s::AbstractRaster)\n\nWrite a Raster to a .grd file with a .gri header file.
