The data can include <a class=\\"highlight-link\\">GeoTIFF</a> or <a class=\\"highlight-link\\">NetCDF</a> files, in-memory Arrays, or <a class=\\"highlight-link\\">CuArrays</a> on the <a class=\\"highlight-link\\">GPU</a>—all of which will behave in the same way.","link":"/manual/data_sources"},{"title":"🗂️🌐 Data Formats","details":"A <a class=\\"highlight-link\\">RasterStack</a> can be backed by a <a class=\\"highlight-link\\">NetCDF</a> or <a class=\\"highlight-link\\">HDF5</a> file, a NamedTuple of Rasters holding <a class=\\"highlight-link\\">.tif</a> files, or all Rasters in memory.
