const TO_KEYWORD = """
- `to`: a `Raster`, `RasterStack`, `Tuple` of `Dimension` or `Extents.Extent`.
    If no `to` object is provided the extent will be calculated from the geometries,
    Additionally, when no `to` object or an `Extent` is passed for `to`, the `size`
    or `res` keyword must also be used.
"""
const SIZE_KEYWORD = """
- `size`: the size of the output array, as a `Tuple{Int,Int}` or single `Int` for a square.
    Only required when `to` is not used or is an `Extents.Extent`, and `res` is not used.
"""
const RES_KEYWORD = """
- `res`: the resolution of the dimensions (often in meters or degrees), a `Real` or `Tuple{<:Real,<:Real}`.
    Only required when `to` is not used or is an `Extents.Extent`, and `size` is not used.
"""
const CRS_KEYWORD = """
- `crs`: a `crs` which will be attached to the resulting raster when `to` not passed
   or is an `Extent`. Otherwise the crs from `to` is used.
"""

const SHAPE_KEYWORDS = """
- `shape`: Force `data` to be treated as `:polygon`, `:line` or `:point` geometries.
    using points or lines as polygons may have unexpected results.
- `boundary`: for polygons, include pixels where the `:center` is inside the polygon,
    where the polygon `:touches` the pixel, or that are completely `:inside` the polygon.
    The default is `:center`.
"""

const THREADED_KEYWORD = """
- `threaded`: run operations in parallel, `false` by default. In some circumstances `threaded` 
    can give large speedups over single-threaded operation. This can be true for complicated 
    geometries written into low-resolution rasters, but may not be for simple geometries with 
    high-resolution rasters. With very large rasters threading may be counter productive due 
    to excessive memory use. Caution should also be used: `threaded` should not be used in in-place 
    functions writing to `BitArray` or other arrays where race conditions can occur.

a [`Raster`](@ref) or one or multiple geometries. Geometries can be

const FILENAME_KEYWORD = """
- `filename`: a filename to write to directly, useful for large files.

- `source`: Usually automatically detected from filepath extension. 
    To manually force, a `Symbol` can be passed `:gdal`, `:netcdf`, `:grd`, `:grib`.
    The internal [`Rasters.Source`](@ref) objects, such as `Rasters.GDALsource()`, 
    `Rasters.GRIBsource()` or `Rasters.NCDsource()` can also be used.

- `ext`: filename extension such as ".tiff" or ".nc".

- `crs`: the coordinate reference system of  the objects `XDim`/`YDim` dimensions.
    Only set this if you know the detected crs is incorrect, or it is not present in
    the file. The `crs` is expected to be a GeoFormatTypes.jl `CRS` or `Mixed` mode `GeoFormat` object,
    like `EPSG(4326)`.
"""
const CONSTRUCTOR_MAPPEDCRS_KEYWORD = """
- `mappedcrs`: the mapped coordinate reference system of the objects `XDim`/`YDim` dimensions.
    for `Mapped` lookups these are the actual values of the index. For `Projected` lookups
    this can be used to index in eg. `EPSG(4326)` lat/lon values, having it converted automatically.
    Only set this if the detected `mappedcrs` in incorrect, or the file does not have a `mappedcrs`,

"""
const GROUP_KEYWORD = """
- `group`: the group in the dataset where `name` can be found. Only needed for nested datasets.

"""

const REPLACE_MISSING_KEYWORD = """
- `replace_missing`: replace `missingval` with `missing`. This is done lazily if `lazy=true`.

    In future `replace_missing=false` will also work for these data sources.
"""

const CHECKMEMORY_KEYWORD = """
- `checkmemory`: If `true` (the default), check if there is enough memory for the operation. 
    `false` will ignore memory needs.
"""

const SCALE_KEYWORD = """

- `raw`: Turn of all scaling and masking and load the raw values from disk.
    `false` by default. If `true`, `scaled` will be set to `false` and `maskingval`

    are manually set to another value.
"""

const SCALED_KEYWORD = """
- `scaled`: apply scale and offset as `x * scale + offset`. `true` by default.
    This is common where data has been convert to e.g. UInt8 to save disk space.
    To ignore `scale` and `offset` metadata, use `scaled=false`. If `scale` and
    Note: `offset` are `1.0` and `0.0` they will be ignored and the original type will 
    be used even when `scaled=true`. This is because these values may be fallback 
    defaults and we do not want to convert every `Real` array to larger `Float64` values.
"""

const COERCE_KEYWORD = """
- `coerce`: where `scale` and/or `offset` are present during `setindex!` to disk, 
    coerce values to the disk type. `convert` is the default, but `round`, `trunc` or
    or `ceil` may be needed where the values are not exact.
"""

const MISSINGVAL_KEYWORD = """
- `missingval`: value representing missing data, normally detected from the file. Set manually
    when you know the value is not specified or is incorrect. This will *not* change any
    values in the raster, it simply assigns which value is treated as missing. 
"""

const MASKINGVAL_KEYWORD = """
- `maskingval`: A value to convert `missingval` to, by default `missing`. If this is set it 
    will be the return value of `missingval(raster)` - `maskingval` becomes the new `missingval`.
    Setting `maskingval` to `nothing` means no masking will occur, and the original `missingval` 
    will be the final `missingval`. This can give better performance than using `missing`. 
    Another efficient option is to use e.g. `zero(eltype(raster))` to replace missing values with zero.

- `chunks`: a `NTuple{N,Int}` specifying the chunk size for each dimension. 
    To specify only specific dimensions, a Tuple of `Dimension` wrapping `Int` 
    or a `NamedTuple` of `Int` can be used. Other dimensions will have a chunk
    size of `1`. `true` can be used to mean: use the original 
    chunk size of the lazy `Raster` being written or X and Y of 256 by 256.
    `false` means don't use chunks at all.

const WRITE_MISSINGVAL_KEYWORD = """
